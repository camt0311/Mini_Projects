# Snapchat_Ads
This project uses real world data from Snapchat, a popular social media app.

### `Part 1`

This part features basic cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data missingness assessment, and a hypothesis test.

I recieved a 93% grade. I still need to find at least one column for which missingness is not dependent.

### `Part 2`

This part features a regression problem to answer a prediction question. 

I recieved a 98% grade. I made a minor error in the conclusion of the permutation test.
